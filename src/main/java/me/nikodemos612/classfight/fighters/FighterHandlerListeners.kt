/**
 * This class is used to handle all the fighters from the game.
 *
 * Want to add a fighter? Just create a new Class, make it inherit the DefaultFighterHandler and add it to the handlers
 * list on this class. Vouala! You created a new fighter! Just don't forget to implement it "canHandle" function
 * comparing their parameter with the name of your fighter, so this class can verify if it should run your class or not.
 *
 * @param plugin the plugin. If you want to print something in console, just add the plugin to the constructor of your
 * fighter, and use "plugin.logger.info()".

    //TODO: Alert!!! This causes a Memory Leak!
    /*
    * Why: Let's imagine you have infinite instances of Fighters;
    *     Basically, all the fighters would be instantiated at once at the start of the plugin, even tho we aren't
    * using any, and would never be caught by the garbage collector. Also, the way that this is implemented makes a
    * verification for all the fighters, event tho there isn't infinite players on the server on all of those infinite
    * fighters teams.
    *
    * Solution:
    *  * Create a companion object only for the verification (you don't need to instantiate the class only to
    * verify if a string is the same as another);
    *  * Make a list of companion objects
    *  * Make an empty list of the Handlers;
    *  * Instantiate a new handler on the empty list only when at least one player is on that team (that is the hard
    * part, there isn't any "ScoreBoardChangeEvent" or something like that)
    *  * Remove the handler of the list if there isn't any players on the team.
    *  * Make the rest of the code use this new list.
    *
    *    This way you can remove the instance of the handler if you are not using it, and you only instantiate it when
    * you actually need it. The list of companion objects is used to verify if the team has a class, and if it has,
    * instantiate it if the team has at least 1 player. It is also used to be an easy implementation of new classes,
    * such as now.
    *
